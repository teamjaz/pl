            <p class="tpara1">
                An Offer for Sale is a method where promoters in public companies sell their shares and reduce their holdings in a transparent manner through a bidding platform. The OFS segment was earlier allowed only for the Promoters/Promoters’ Group Entities of listed Companies, to act as ‘Sellers’ to dilute/offload their holding to achieve minimum public shareholding of 25%.
            </p>
            <p class="tpara1">
                Now, however, the segment has been extended to non-promoters of eligible companies holding at least 10% of share capital of the company.
