            <p class="tpara1">
                A will is a legal document that expresses a person’s instructions for the distribution of their assets after their demise and identifies the person assigned the responsibility of managing the assets until distribution.

                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                    <li>A will ensures that all assets are distributed and disposed of as per the wishes of the person drawing up the will. In the absence of a will, the assets are distributed to all legal heirs in the proportion applicable as per succession laws, regardless of the wishes of the deceased person.</li>
                    <li>Even a solitary asset such as a demat account or an insurance policy requires a will. The absence of one can lead to misunderstandings, family disputes and lengthy legal battles.</li>
                    <li>Humans are mortal. A will made during a medical illness could be deemed invalid. A will can be revised any number of times; the last-drawn up will alone is treated as valid.</li>
                    <li>A will facilitates the smooth transfer of assets to the beneficiaries. Being a legal document, a valid will is legally accepted.</li>
