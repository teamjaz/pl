                    <li>NCDs are a debt instrument with a fixed tenure and people who invest in these receive regular interest at a certain rate</li>

                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>High interest rates in comparison to FDs. NCDs offer returns up to 12% and have maturity ranging from 90 days to 20 years, making it an attractive option for short term as well as long term investors </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>Listed on stock exchanges, NCDs are easy to withdraw as compared to FDs but a little tougher than simply selling your stock and getting the redemption credit in your bank account </li>

                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>NCDs are either secured or unsecured NCDs. Secured NCDs have to fulfill debt obligations since they are backed by the issuing company’s assets. Unsecured NCDs on the other hand have no such debt obligations </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>NCDs are rated by agencies such as FITCH, ICRA, CRISIL and CARE and the ratings depend upon the company’s ability to service its debt on time. A lower rating means a higher credit risk </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>Check the company’s history regarding paying its debts on time, how much capital it raised etc. A good company would have fulfilled its debt obligations on time </li>
