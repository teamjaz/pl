            <p class="tpara1">
                was boosted with the surge in venture capital investments. However, caught in the confusion of many regulations, the Venture Capital Fund (“VCF”) vehicle came to be used by many other funds such as private equity (“PE”), private investment in public equity, real estate, etc., thereby making it difficult to give targeted concessions to VCFs to promote startup or early stage companies.
            </p>
            <p class="tpara1">
                It is in this background that in 2012 the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) introduced the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (the “AIF Regulations”) and to recognise AIFs, such as PEs and VCFs, as a distinct asset class apart from promoter holdings, creditors and public investors.

                    <!-- <h4>What Is An AIF?</h4>-->
                    <p class="main-para-1">Any privately pooled investment vehicle, established or incorporated in India, in the form of a trust or a
        company or a limited liability partnership (“LLP”) or a body corporate, not covered under any other SEBI or
        sectoral regulations. Such privately pooled investment vehicle may collect funds from investors, whether
        Indian or foreign, for investing such funds in accordance with defined investment policies
         <br>
         <br>
        Specific exclusions include family trusts, employee stock option trusts, employee welfare trusts or gratuity
        trusts, holding companies, special purpose vehicles not established by fund managers and regulated
        under a specific regulatory framework (eg. securitization trusts), and funds managed by registered
        securitisation or reconstruction companies.
         <br>
         <br>
        
        Apart from the registration and compliance requirements under the AIF Regulations, each AIF also needs
        to be compliant with the applicable statutes, depending upon the chosen structure of trust, LLP or a
        company. Apart from these, there are also filing and audit requirements for a company and an LLP. As
        such, a trust is the more favoured structure amongst the existing AIFs in India, since the regulatory
        framework governing trust structures is minimal and allows the management independence with respect
        to formulating its own standards of governance.

                   <!--  <h4>Registration as AIF</h4>-->
                    <p class="main-para-1 ">The AIF Regulations make it mandatory to obtain certificate of registration from SEBI for enabling AIFs to operate under one of the following 3 categories:<br> <br>
        Category I – AIFs which invest in start-up or early stage ventures or social ventures or SMEs or infrastructure. Includes venture capital funds, SME funds, social venture funds, infrastructure funds, angel funds, etc. <br> <br>
        Angel funds, which is of particular topical interest, means funds pooling investments from angel investors, having net worth of at least Rs. 10 Crores (if a body corporate); or net tangible assets of at least Rs. 2 Crores, excluding value of principal residence, and experience as a serial entrepreneur, or being a senior management professional with at least 10 years of experience (if individual).
        <br> <br>
        Category II – AIFs, which do not fall in Category I or Category III and which do not undertake leverage or borrowing other than to meet day-to-day operational requirements. Includes private equity funds or debt funds for which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the government or any other regulator.
        <br> <br>
        Category III – AIFs, which employ diverse or complex trading strategies and may employ leverage including through investment in listed or unlisted derivatives. Includes hedge funds or funds, which trade for short term returns, or open ended funds, for which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the government or any other regulator.

                     <!--<h4>Pass-Through Taxation Of AIFs</h4>-->
                    <p class="main-para-1">Category I enjoys the tax benefits of pass-through status and the Finance Act, 2015, extended a pass-through status to Category II AIFs as a response to a long standing industry demand. <br> <br>What it essentially means is that income on an investment fund (defined as a Category I or Category II AIF), is exempted from tax and such income is chargeable to income-tax in the hands of the unit-holder in the same manner as if the investments made by the investment fund has been made directly by the unit-holder. <br> <br>Overall, the AIF Regulations have been a welcome change and have been quite successful in providing separate incentives and imposing separate obligations for the various categories and subcategories of AIFs. <br> <br></p>
