                An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock
            </p>
            <p class="tpara1">
                An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies.

                    <li>An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange, just like a stock. </li>

                    <li>2</li>
                    <li>ETF share prices fluctuate all day as the ETF is bought and sold; this is different from mutual funds that only trade once a day after the market closes </li>

            <h3 class="stitle mt30">Advantages of ETFs</h3>

                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>There are numerous advantages to ETFs, especially when compared to mutual funds.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>Diversification: One ETF can give exposure to a group of equities, market segments, or styles. An ETF can track a broader range of stocks, or even attempt to mimic the returns of a country or a group of countries </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>Trades Like a Stock: Although the ETF might give the holder the benefits of diversification, it has the trading liquidity of equity. In particular:</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>ETFs also allow you to manage risk by trading futures and options just like a stock</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3 class="stitle mt30">Lower Fees</h3>
            <p class="tpara1">
                ETFs, which are passively managed, have much lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds, which mutual funds tend to be. What drives up a mutual fund's expense ratio? Costs such as a management fee, shareholder accounting expenses at the fund level, service fees like marketing, paying a board of directors, and load fees for sale and distribution.
            </p>
            <h3 class="stitle mt30">Limited Capital Gains Tax</h3>
            <p class="tpara1">
                ETFs can be more tax-efficient than mutual funds. As passively managed portfolios, ETFs (and index funds) tend to realize fewer capital gains than actively managed mutual funds. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are required to distribute capital gains to shareholders if the manager sells securities for a profit.
