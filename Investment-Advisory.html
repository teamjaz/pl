            The Trader’s Edge bouquet offers a variety of positional trading and market-neutral strategies deploying derivatives trading. These strategies are developed using proprietary algorithms and continuously optimised to give you quick advice on stocks and indices. Each positional trade comes with a stop loss, a trailing stop loss and uses only the most liquid and fundamentally-sound instruments. In addition, a portfolio-level stop loss is also advised to ensure that a deep drawdown doesn’t impact a portfolio beyond a point. Trader’s Edge participates in both, long and short sides – using all potential volatility to your advantage. So if you are a positional trader, it is quite likely this what you are looking for.
