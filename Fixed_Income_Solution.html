Earn steady returns while your capital remains protected. 54EC Bonds, or Capital Gains Bonds, are among the best options to save long-term Capital Gains Tax, offering a tax exemption on these gains. You can also opt for Sovereign Gold Bonds and earn an assured interest, while benefiting from the appreciation in the price of gold, as it acts as a hedge against inflation. </span></li>
