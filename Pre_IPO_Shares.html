                A pre-initial public offering (IPO) placement is a private sale of large blocks of shares before a stock is listed on a public exchange. The buyers are typically private equity firms, hedge funds, and other institutions willing to buy large stakes in the firm
            </p>
            <p class="tpara1">
                Due to the size of the investments being made and the risks involved, the buyers in a pre-IPO placement usually get a discount from the price stated in the prospective for the IPO.

                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>From the perspective of a young company, a pre-IPO placement is a way to raise money before going public. It also is a way to offset the risk that the IPO price will prove to be optimistic, and the price will not go up immediately after it opens </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>From the buyer's perspective, the amount per share may be discounted from the expected IPO price, but there is no way to know the price per share that the market will actually pay </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>The company, however, does not want these private buyers to immediately sell all their shares if their stock soars once it opens on an exchange. To prevent this, a lock-up period is generally attached to the placement, preventing the buyer from selling shares in the short-term</li>
